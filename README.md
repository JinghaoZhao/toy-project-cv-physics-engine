# A toy project using OpenCV, PyMunk and Mediapipe
Creating a simple augmented reality game using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pymunk.   

**For a tutorial on how to develop such applications, please read my blog post [Having fun with Computer Vision and Physics](https://amirabbasasadi.github.io/vision/python/2021/06/03/having-fun-with-computer-vision-and-physics.html)**
